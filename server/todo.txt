Build out a server side application that receives API requests
Should then use the info from the API to complete a macro

Phase 1:
Receive a request for a key (like a letter or a function key) and execute it

Things to Think About:

How will the users change the macros for a certain app?

It would have to be done on the server side, so then the client also needs to pick up
the settings from the server on launch and load them in

Also macro images should be able to changed in this app

Should this also be an electron app?
